Simply press the GreenFlag and it works!

VERSION HISTORY and CREDITS: See Notes and Credits.

NOTE: This could stop working at any time, as there was a bug where rotating it would cause it to move to the wrong place. I think it's a problem with the images, but it could be an issue with Scratch.
UPDATE: fixed :)

TODO: Add a manual mode where the project keeps track of your left, right, up, down, and you move it with arrow keys. Not right now tho.
Organise it into custom blocks so it's easier to read.

VERSION HISTORY
=================
v.0.0.1-stable; Add the base project. Has the score counter, the pacman, and a strawberry. Has some text. Completely unfinished.
v.0.0.2-stable; Mess around with the timing. Partially finished the first strawberry movement. Rename points variable to eaten.
v.0.0.3-stable; Put stuff in custom blocks. No other changes.
v.0.0.4-stable; Finish first strawberry. ~~Move custom block `wait' into backdrop code.~~ nevermind that doesn't work; I actually copied it into each sprite A few minor changes. Add all the costumes - costume 5 has been replaced by hide and is simply there for historical reasons. Still not public.
v.0.0.5-stable; Backend fixes. Moves the Yum Yum! code into a custom block for readability purposes. Uses the callbacks eatEatEat2 and eatEatEat3 for the second and third sprites, respectively.
v.0.0.6-stable; Fix the bug with rotating. I will need to redo all the coordinates which is not done in this version. Move strawberries to correct places - but this won't work as I just said.
v.0.0.7-stable; Fix all the coordinates except PacMan. Fix PacMan skin because I forgot about him :(
v.0.0.8-stable; Fix PacMan coordinates. Remove useless code that wasn't doing anything. Fix remnant of debugging what was wrong with eatEatEat (it was that the strawberries were all piled up) where eatEatEat was outside of the main function. Minor improvements.
v.0.0.8.2-stable; Add original PacMan. Probably I forgot other changes but that's the major change.
v.0.0.9-stable; Bugfixes. Minor changes. Second strawberry completed. Remove useless code. 
v.0.1.0-stable; Third and fourth strawberries completed. Minor changes. Add basis for cool new feature. A bugfix or two.
v.0.1.1-stable; Minor changes. Implement new ending. Share project. Probably the last version.
v.0.1.2-stable; Ok I was wrong. Sue me. Fix "-1 to 10" to "0 to 10".

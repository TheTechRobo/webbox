  <h1>About me</h1>

  <h2>Hi, I'm Ittussarom</h2>
  <p>I got into programming when I was seven or eight, getting a book called <i>Python for Kids</i> (I highly recommend it) for my birthday. It was a really good book, but I got discouraged when the program it told me to make had a typo that, because I sucked back then, I couldn't figure out. So, I stoppped for awhile and learned HTML from a book called "CoderDojo NANO: Build your own WEBSITE!" and I loved HTML. You can see my crappy HTML and JavaScript <a href="http://thetechrobo.byethost8.com">here</a>.
    Then, though, I found <i>Python for Kids</i> on my bookshelf, and I decided to make a quiz. Which then turned into <a href="https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-shell">CustPy</a>, which was <b>THE</b> crappiest program ever created â€” it wouldn't even compile! But I learned a LOT about GitHub and Git that way. So it was OK. It also had way too many <i>Lost</i> references. My last commit was on August 20, 2019.
    <br />
    By now I had about two weeks until I started <b>gui-app</b>, which was my first GUI program, written in Tkinter. It was also crappy, and was mostly a testrun of Tkinter, so after a bit I stopped.
    <br>I have been skipping many small repos in this history. In late July 2019, I forked GitHub user lewiswatson55's repo <b>Python_Text_Calculator</b>. I had been developing it on and off for a while, but now that I had barely anything to work on, I started working on it more and more. And it got plenty of new features.<br />
    In about November 2019 I started work on a small program called BGLUGwatch -- that would show the latest mailing list data and articles from the website. In about January 2020, I got sick of it, and paused development of it. In python-text-calculator by now I was at v.0.4-omega.3.But in early April 2020, I finally restarted it, and by now Palc was at v.0.5-stable, introducing area.py interactivity. <br />
    Right now BGLUGwatch is only being updated for the latest meeting data and mailing list stuff because the rolling-release system doesn't work. I have been asking on Stack Overflow for a week and a half but to no avail. Palc has gotten to v.0.6.4-stable !!!!!! Whoa! It's now turning into a scientific-and-business calculator.
    <br />Anyway, thank you for your interest in my boring and useless life, and have a good day -- or, what's left of it.
